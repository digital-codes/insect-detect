This repository contains Python scripts and [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5),
[YOLOv6](https://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6), [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7)
and [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) object detection models
([.blob format](https://docs.luxonis.com/software/ai-inference/conversion/)) for testing
and deploying the **Insect Detect** DIY camera trap for automated insect monitoring.

The camera trap system is composed of low-cost off-the-shelf hardware components
([Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/),
[Luxonis OAK-1](https://docs.luxonis.com/hardware/products/OAK-1),
[Witty Pi 4 L3V7](https://www.uugear.com/product/witty-pi-4-l3v7/)), combined with
open source software and can be easily assembled and set up with the
[provided instructions](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/).

- All models were trained to 300 epochs with batch size 32 and default hyperparameters. Reproduce the
  model training with the provided [Google Colab notebooks](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect-ml#model-training).
- Trained on [Insect_Detect_detection](https://universe.roboflow.com/maximilian-sittinger/insect_detect_detection)
  dataset [version 7](https://universe.roboflow.com/maximilian-sittinger/insect_detect_detection/dataset/7),
  downscaled to 320x320 pixel with only 1 class ("insect").
- Model metrics (mAP, Precision, Recall) are shown for the original PyTorch (.pt) model before conversion to ONNX ->
  OpenVINO -> .blob format. Reproduce metrics by using the respective model validation method.

## Processing pipeline

All configuration parameters can be customized in the web app or by directly modifying the
[`config_custom.yaml`](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect/tree/main/configs/config_custom.yaml)
file. You can generate multiple custom configuration files and select the active config either in
the web app or by modifying the
[`config_selector.yaml`](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect/blob/main/configs/config_selector.yaml).

Processing pipeline for the
[`trigger_capture.py`](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect/blob/main/trigger_capture.py)
script that can be used for automated insect monitoring:

- A custom **YOLO insect detection model** is run in real time on device (OAK) and uses a
  continuous stream of downscaled LQ frames as input.
- An **object tracker** uses the bounding box coordinates of detected insects to assign a unique
  tracking ID to each individual present in the frame and track its movement through time.
- The tracker + model output from inference on LQ frames is synchronized with
  **MJPEG-encoded HQ frames** (default: 3840x2160 px) on device (OAK).
- The HQ frames are saved to the microSD card at the configured **capture intervals** while
  an insect is detected (triggered capture) and independent of detections (time-lapse capture).
- Corresponding **metadata** from the detection model and tracker output is saved to a
  metadata .csv file for each detected and tracked insect (including timestamp, label,
  confidence score, tracking ID, tracking status and bounding box coordinates).
- The bounding box coordinates can be used to **crop detected insects** from the corresponding
  HQ frames and save them as individual .jpg images. Depending on the post-processing configuration,
  the original HQ frames are optionally deleted to save storage space.
- If a power management board (Witty Pi 4 L3V7 or PiJuice Zero) is connected and enabled in the
  configuration, **intelligent power management** is activated which includes battery charge level
  monitoring with conditional recording durations.
- With the default configuration, running the recording consumes **~3.8 W** of power.
